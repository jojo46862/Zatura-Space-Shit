The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter.
The plane that most people are fully aware of. Most campaigns take place on this plane, but some might reach the planes.

### DISCOVERY
This is where our intrepid adventure begin my dear readers. This plane is one of general existence as most within our world knows it. I could go back and describe how our planet came into existence, but that is not what the material plane has to offer. In face, our world is one of many within the plane with many having their own interesting history. Some of them are technologically advanced and have developed their own travel through the astral sea, while others have unfortunately been undone by their own advancement and their worlds have met their ends. I might include a few interesting picks within the end of this chapter if I remember to. I've been looking around for the passages to other planes, but have been getting distracted by the vast potential of this plane. 

### SURVIVAL
Each planet has it's own biosphere that is to be noted and generally understood for your own survival. The plane itself lacks breathable air so stay within the gravity sphere of your ship and your survival will greatly increase. The nature of this plane being surrounded by all other planes means that it is one that has unique dangers from all the rest. Prepare yourself for anything and everything as the danger, while not focused, is diverse.

### THE LOCALS
Within the material plane you can find all sorts of races. There are very few races that do not reside or even travel to the material plane, but those who don't come here normally are the really nasty bastards. Odds are if you are reading this book you are not well versed in the planes, so lets get started. You got your common Dwarfs, Elves, Gnomes, Dragonborn, Humans, and more. The interesting races are those with connections to the [[Astral Plane]], including the Kalashtar, Githyanki, Githzerai, and Mind Flayers. Oh yeah mind flayers, those guys are real assholes. They mess with your mind and just really mess you up. A few of them are know to travel to planets and attempt to take part of the population to turn into more mind flayers. It's disgusting and I've had a few crappy encounters with these mind flayers.

### MYSTERIES
A few of the questions within the realm are how did it come to be? Did all life originate from this plane? Why do all the planes circle around this one? All grand questions with not direct answers

### POLITICS/RELIGION
This plane is typically treated as a neutral zone for politics and religion but that doesn't quite stop people from arguing and trying to convert you one way or another. If I had to hear about the monstrous nature of those Apholosians or the doom that approaches Zatura I am going to have a migraine. Generally people approach
