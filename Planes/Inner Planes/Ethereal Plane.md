The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog--bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the [[Material Plane]] and the Inner Planes, so that every Location on those planes has a corresponding Location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain Creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the See Invisibility and True Seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical Effects also extend from the [[Material Plane]] into the Border Ethereal, particularly Effects that use force energy such as Forcecage and Wall of Force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.

The world under the world, the ethereal plane exists as a mirror that is hidden from normal eyes. Everything that exists within the [[Material Plane]], [[Feywild]], and [[Shadowfell]]
