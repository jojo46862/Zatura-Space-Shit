At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the [[Material Plane]] (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the [[Material Plane]]. The Four Elements mingle together as they do in the [[Material Plane]], forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the [[Material Plane]], though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and Hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest formâ€”great expanses of solid earth, blazing [[fire]], crystal--clear [[water]], and unsullied [[air]]. These Regions are little--known, so when discussing the Plane of [[Fire]], for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.
