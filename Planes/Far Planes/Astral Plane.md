The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors Travel as disembodied souls to reach The Planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same Above and Below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic Whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
